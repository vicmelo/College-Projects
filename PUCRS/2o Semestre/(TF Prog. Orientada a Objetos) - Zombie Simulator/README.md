#Zombie Simulator v1.0

This is a project developed for the Object Oriented Programming class, where the objective was to apply the concepts learned of object oriented paradigm, including design patterns, using Java language. To try it, you can execute SimuladorZumbi.jar. When the interface be opened, click on "novo", select the number of humans, the percentage of humans that are friendly (humans not friendly attack another humans) and then select the number of zombies. To start simulating, select the number of rounds you want to advance on the text box and click on "avan√ßar".

The map size is 100x100, this way, the max number of characters is 10.000.
The graph on the right shows the number of humans and zombies alive. When all humans or zombies die, the simulation ends. 

You can still save and load a simulation (just one, it uses the same file for all saved simulations) or restart a simulation.
